# Terrania

A geography quiz web app written in Angular 2.

## Development
* First, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Then install Angular CLI globally: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
* Navigate to the project folder and type `npm install package.json` to install the required dependency
* Finally, type `ng serve`. The website is now live at localhost:4200 and ready for live coding.

## Contributing
* Angular 2 uses TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript. If you are not familiar with them, take the [official tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/) or [this Microsoft tutorial](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/introduction-to-angular-20-16540)
* This app uses [Materialize](materializecss.org) for styling.
* Please indent with 2 spaces and use spaces, not tabs.
